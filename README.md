# ⚡ Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes

_A Harry Potter themed e-commerce marketplace_

## Introduction

Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes is a full-stack marketplace where multiple
wizarding shop owners sell magical joke-shop products (Skiving Snackboxes,
Love Potions, Daydream Charms, and more), and customers browse, buy, review,
and favorite them.

A shop owner can register a shop, but it stays **pending** until the
platform Admin authorizes it.a shop cannot post products before approval.
Customers browse only authorized shops, add items to a persistent cart,
check out through a themed mock "Gringotts" payment flow, track orders
through Owl Post delivery stages, and leave reviews (optionally with their
own photos). The Admin has platform-wide oversight: authorizing/suspending
shops and deleting any product directly, for example after a pattern of bad
reviews.

**Roles:** Admin, Shop Owner, Customer
**Stack:** FastAPI (Python) + PostgreSQL on the back end, React on the front
end, JWT authentication, Cloudinary for image uploads.

| ---- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| US01 | Customer   | As a customer, I want to register and log in, so that I can save a cart, checkout, and track my own orders.                                 | Register/login returns a JWT; guests cannot checkout or review            |
| US02 | Customer   | As a customer, I want to browse products from authorized shops only, so that I don't see unapproved or suspended sellers.                   | Product list excludes shops where `is_authorized` is false                |
| US03 | Customer   | As a customer, I want to filter products by category, so that I can find what I'm looking for quickly.                                      | Category filter returns only matching products                            |
| US04 | Customer   | As a customer, I want to view multiple images per product, so that I can see the item clearly before buying.                                | Product detail displays all URLs in `image_urls`                          |
| US05 | Customer   | As a customer, I want to add products to a cart with live stock limits, so that I can't order more than what's in stock.                    | Cart blocks quantity above current stock                                  |
| US06 | Customer   | As a customer, I want to apply a coupon code at checkout, so that I can get a discount.                                                     | Valid code reduces total; invalid code shows an error                     |
| US07 | Customer   | As a customer, I want to complete a mock checkout, so that an order is created with my cart contents.                                       | `order` + `order_items` are created; cart clears after success            |
| US08 | Customer   | As a customer, I want to view my own order history and status, so that I know where my order is.                                            | `GET /orders` returns only the logged-in user's own orders                |
| US09 | Customer   | As a customer, I want to write a review with a star rating and optional images, so that I can share my experience.                          | Review saved with rating, comment, and `image_urls`; linked to my user id |
| US10 | Customer   | As a customer, I want to edit or delete my own review, so that I can correct or remove my feedback.                                         | PUT/DELETE blocked unless `review.user_id` matches the logged-in user     |
| US11 | Customer   | As a customer, I want to mark a product as a favorite, so that I can find it again quickly.                                                 | Favorites list returns only my favorited products                         |
| US12 | Shop Owner | As a shop owner, I want to register a shop, so that I can start selling once approved.                                                      | New shop is created with `is_authorized = false` by default               |
| US13 | Shop Owner | As a shop owner, I want to be blocked from posting products until my shop is authorized, so that only approved sellers appear to customers. | `POST /products` returns 403 if `shop.is_authorized` is false             |
| US14 | Shop Owner | As a shop owner, I want to add a product with multiple images, so that customers can see it clearly.                                        | Images upload to Cloudinary via the backend; URLs saved in `image_urls`   |
| US15 | Shop Owner | As a shop owner, I want to edit or delete only my own products, so that I can't affect other shops' listings.                               | PUT/DELETE blocked unless `product.shop_id` belongs to my shop            |
| US16 | Shop Owner | As a shop owner, I want to view orders containing my products, so that I know what I need to fulfill.                                       | Orders endpoint filters `order_items` by my shop's product ids            |
| US17 | Admin      | As an admin, I want to view and authorize pending shops, so that only legitimate shops can sell.                                            | `PUT /admin/shops/{id}/authorize` flips `is_authorized` to true           |
| US18 | Admin      | As an admin, I want to suspend a shop, so that I can remove it from the platform if needed.                                                 | Suspended shop's products stop appearing to customers                     |
| US19 | Admin      | As an admin, I want to delete any product on the platform, so that I can remove items with a pattern of bad reviews.                        | `DELETE /products/{id}` succeeds for admin regardless of shop ownership   |
| US20 | Admin      | As an admin, I want to view all shops, products, and orders platform-wide, so that I have full oversight.                                   | Admin-only endpoints return all records, not just the admin's own         |

**Color key:** 🟣 Purple = core app shell · 🔵 Blue = shared/public pages · 🟢 Green = Customer-only pages · 🟡 Gold = Shop Owner-only pages · 🔴 Red = Admin-only pages · 🟦 Teal = reused component (same component, multiple places)

### Shared context / state (not rendered components, but wrap the tree)

| Context       | Purpose                                                                            | Used by                                                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AuthContext` | Stores logged-in user, JWT token, role; provides login/logout functions            | Navbar, RoleRoute, every page that needs `user.role` or `user.id` |
| `CartContext` | Stores cart items in memory (not a DB table), provides add/remove/update functions | ProductDetail (Add to Cart), Cart, Checkout                       |

### Reused components

- `ProductCard` is used in both `ProductList` and `Favorites` — same component, different data source
- `RoleRoute` wraps `ShopRegistration`, `ShopDashboard`, `AddEditProduct` (Shop Owner only) and `AdminDashboard` (Admin only), redirecting anyone without the right role

---

## API Routes

All routes except register/login require a JWT in the `Authorization`
header. Role checks are enforced server-side.

| Method | Route                         | Purpose                                             | Access                         |

## Attributions

Product names and categories are inspired by J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter
series (Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes); all product descriptions, images, and
code in this project are original. No official movie stills, logos, or book
text are used.

## Next Steps (Stretch Goals)

- Move `categories` into a proper relational table managed by the Admin
- Move `coupons` into an admin-managed table with activation/expiry dates
- Real payment integration (Stripe test mode) instead of a mock checkout
- Email notifications when an order status changes
