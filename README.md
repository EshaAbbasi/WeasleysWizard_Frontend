## 🪄 About the App

**Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes** is a Harry Potter themed e-commerce marketplace where multiple wizarding shop owners sell magical joke-shop products, and customers can browse, buy, review and favorite them. Find wands, trunks, house apparel and magical gifts, all in one enchanted place.

A shop owner registers a shop, which stays **pending** until the platform Admin authorizes it. A shop cannot post products before approval. Once approved, the owner manages their own products (with multiple images uploaded via Cloudinary). Customers browse only authorized shops, add items to a cart, check out through a themed mock **Gringotts** payment flow, track orders through **Owl Post** delivery stages, and leave reviews (optionally with their own photos). The Admin has platform-wide oversight: authorizing or suspending shops, and deleting any product, for example after reviewing a pattern of bad reviews.

### 💡 Why I built it

I built this as my capstone project for the General Assembly software engineering course. I wanted something fun that is also a real, full-stack marketplace: three user roles, role-based permissions enforced on the server, image uploads, and a full purchase flow, all wrapped in a world I love.

### Repository structure

```
WeasleysWizard/
├── frontend/     React app (deployed on Vercel)
├── backend/      FastAPI app (deployed on Render)
├── docs/         Planning materials (project plan PDF)
├── assets/       Logo and screenshot used in this README
└── README.md
```

### Run it locally

**1. Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EshaAbbasi/WeasleysWizard.git
cd WeasleysWizard
```

**2. Start the back-end** (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/.env` (adjust names to match your code):

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/postgres   # Supabase connection string
SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret
ALGORITHM=HS256
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:8000` and the Swagger docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

**3. Start the front-end** (React), in a second terminal

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env
npm run dev
```

> If your front-end uses Create React App instead of Vite, use `REACT_APP_API_URL` and `npm start`.
